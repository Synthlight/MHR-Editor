RE4:
        Add a UI system to handle enum flags for `Chainsaw_RandomDrop_DropGroup`.

DD2:
        App_ItemShortcutParameter has item arrays which are generic list wrappers and break the item enum button.
        Via_AnimationCurve is using the new UIntArray container but the UI can't display it.

RE8:
        `app.TPSCameraConditionSetting`1<via.vec3>` generates with a `ObservableCollection<Via_vec3>` from `System.Collections.Generic.List`1<app.TPSCameraConditionSetting`1.Setting<via.vec3>>`.

    Add some truncated version of the full name with ellipses so it's at least obvious there's hover text.
