RE4:
        Add a UI system to handle enum flags for `Chainsaw_RandomDrop_DropGroup`.
            (Flags are now supported in generation.)

DD2:
        App_ItemShortcutParameter has item arrays which are generic list wrappers and break the item enum button.
        Via_AnimationCurve is using the new UIntArray container but the UI can't diplay it.

        App_AttackUserData (HumanShellParamData_Job08.user.2)
            This instance (app.AttackUserData[1729]) has a field `v1` which is apparently `via.physics.UserData[1722]`.
            Except I don't know where/how this happens because the field is just defined as:
            ```
                "e7bd8658": {
                        "crc": "b95444cd",
                        "fields": [
                                {
                                        "align": 4,
                                        "array": false,
                                        "name": "v0",
                                        "native": true,
                                        "original_type": "",
                                        "size": 4,
                                        "type": "String"
                                },
                                {
                                        "align": 4,
                                        "array": false,
                                        "name": "v1",
                                        "native": true,
                                        "original_type": "",
                                        "size": 4,
                                        "type": "Data"
                                },
            ``
            And it's not `UserData` so I don't know why this one, unlike others, has instance data.


Show column primitive type below the header text.
    Show the full type name on header hover.
    Add some truncated version of the full name with ellipses so it's at least obvious there's hover text.


Fix nexus links in the error messages, enable the updated, set version numbers, etc.


Add a system to stop people from opening files that won't write out, and maybe even tell the user to actually read the list of passing tests.
