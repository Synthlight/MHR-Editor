RE4:
	Add a UI system to handle enum flags for `Chainsaw_RandomDrop_DropGroup`.
	Some structs inherit from others and right now there's no good way of doing that except some hard-coded hack.

DD2:
	App_ItemShortcutParameter has item arrays which are generic list wrappers and break the item enum button.
	Via_AnimationCurve is using the new UIntArray container but the UI can't diplay it.
