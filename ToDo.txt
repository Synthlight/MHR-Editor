RE4:
	Add a UI system to handle enum flags for `Chainsaw_RandomDrop_DropGroup`.
	    (Flags are now supported in generation.)
	Some structs inherit from others and right now there's no good way of doing that except some hard-coded hack.

DD2:
	App_ItemShortcutParameter has item arrays which are generic list wrappers and break the item enum button.
	Via_AnimationCurve is using the new UIntArray container but the UI can't diplay it.

Show column primitive type below the header text.
    Show the full type name on header hover.
    Add some truncated version of the full name with ellipses so it's at least obvious there's hover text.
